# AI Powered Commerce Insights Platform 🚀  
**(Coming Soon)**

An AI-driven, cloud-native platform designed to deliver real-time commerce insights using modern GenAI, observability, and scalable microservices architecture.

This project focuses on combining **FastAPI**, **AWS Bedrock**, **Kubernetes**, and **end-to-end observability** to showcase how intelligent analytics platforms can be built for modern digital commerce systems.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The **AI Powered Commerce Insights Platform** is designed to:
- Ingest and process commerce data streams (orders, payments, user behavior)
- Generate AI-powered insights using GenAI models
- Expose real-time analytics via APIs
- Provide deep observability into system performance and data flows

This repository will serve as a **portfolio-grade reference implementation** for building production-ready GenAI platforms.
